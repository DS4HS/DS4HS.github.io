## Program
- Originally a Grant proposal
- Saturday Data Science Workshops with Local High school Students
- Goal:
  - Reaching students from diverse backgrounds of ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status.      - Making content accessible for those of all incoming skill levels and educational backgrounds.

## Why City Planning 

- Students care about their cities, neighborhoods, lives
- expressed interest in social justice but want practical application
- Faces of City Design to be explored
  - traffic  
  - environmental access  
  - crime & housing  
  - infrastructure inequality

## The Urban Planning Cycle is the Data Science Cycle

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
  digraph cycle {
    graph [rankdir=LR]
    node [shape = ellipse, style=filled, color=lightblue, width= 1, height= 1, fontsize=12]
    
    Observe [label='Observe a Problem']
    Collect [label='Collect Data']
    Analyze [label='Analyze & Present']
    Intervene [label='Intervene']
    Evaluate [label='Evaluate & Repeat']


    Observe -> Collect -> Analyze -> Intervene -> Evaluate -> Observe
  }
")
```


## Course Goals and Curriculum Connections. 


## Goal 1: Build Confidence in Problem Solving

- **Goal** Build confidence through interaction with tangible examples
- Students will engage with real-world city planning issues, learning to break the problem down into concrete questions and hypotheses


## Goal 2: Broaden the Scope of Imagination

- **Goal** Help students see the bigger picture of data within scientific reasoning
- Understanding how and why data is collected in order to solve minor problems within a web of interconnected issues. 

## Goal 3: Professional development 

- **Goal:** Promote higher education and career goals by connecting data science to numerous professional fields. 

- Emphasizing the importance of communicating and presenting data effectively
- Numerous career paths within the range of urban planning -> spark interest in higher education in data science  

## Goal 4: Foundational Skills

- **Goal:** Increased confidence in understanding basic data science concepts. 
  - Asking insightful questions and hypothesis formation
  - Identifying unbiased and helpful data
  - Data wrangling and exploration
  - data visualization and communication

## What do we want to know

- **Its not always easy to start analyzing such a large data set. Thats why it is important to ask SMART questions**
- **S**pecific: Clear, detailed, and not too broad
- **M**easureable: Can be answered using the available data
- **A**pplicable: Tied to real-world meaningful contexts
- **R**easoned: Based on logic or a thoughtful assumption
- **T**estable: Can be analyzed to reveal patterns or relationships

  select(GEOID, tes, pctpovnorm, unemplnorm, lingnorm, tc_gap)

ca_merged <- ca_tracts|>
  left_join(ca_tes_clean, by = "GEOID")
```
```{r}
ca_tes_clean
```

```{r}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)

library(stringr)
```


```{r}

ggplot(ca_merged) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = tes), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Tree Equity Score by Census Tract in California",
       fill = "TES")
