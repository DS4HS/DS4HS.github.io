One of the main goals of this curriculum is to make content as tangible as possible for those with little to no experience in data or statistical analysis. This section introduces key concepts in data science and we want to make sure these concepts are grasped as thoroughly as possible.\n\nObservation vs. Observational Unit: Be explicit—each row is one observation, and the observational unit is the “thing” each row represents (e.g., a tree, a bus stop, a city block). In this example the “GEOID” represents one city block group.\nAsk: “What is one row describing?” Have students answer in plain language.\nVariable Types: Clarify the difference between categorical and numerical variables. Use color/highlight in your slides or board to mark a few examples from the dataset. Students often confuse column headers for variable values. Reinforce that variables are columns, values are entries in rows.\nIf possible, have students follow along in R to observe the data set. This can help them get used to the variable names and what a typical value looks like for a given variable."

The goal of an activity like this is to help students commit data wrangling and visualization strategies to memory and think bout the processes critically.\nIn-Class Data Wrangling Practice\n\n6.1 Core Goals\n\nStudents experience transforming a dataset using tidyverse data verbs\nThey start asking questions of the data: Who’s impacted? Where? What relationships exist?\nStudents see visualization as a tool for insight, not just graphics.\n\n\n\n6.2 Pedagogical Tips and Emphases\n1. Emphasize the “verbs” as actions\n\nAnchor each function to a mental model:\n\nfilter() = “cut out rows you don’t need”\nselect() = “keep only the columns you care about”\nmutate() = “make new columns using calucaltions with exsisting ones”\ngroupby() = “Sort data into baskets by value”\nsummarize() = “Pull out the big-picture”\n\n\n2. Highlight data types when visualizing\n\nCategorical → bar/column\nContinuous → histogram, scatter\nTime-based → line plot\nEncourage asking: “What kind of variable is this? What would help me see patterns?”\n\n3. Don’t skip reading outputs\n\nStop after each code chunk and ask: “What changed? What does this output tell us?”\nIt’s easy for students to focus on syntax and miss what the data is really saying.\n\n4. Ask real-world connection questions\n\n“What trend do you notice?”, “What might explain that relationship?”, “What other variable might influence both?”\nEncourage students to answer these questions in normal and confortable language rather than expecting a more refined “data-sciency” answer. This will help bridge the gap between their common sense and trained data analysis"

What variable would show that?”\n\n\n\n7.2 Managing Student Presentations\nEach group should give a short (~3–4 min) presentation of:\n\nTheir question/data use\nTheir data wrangling process\nTheir plot(s) and the trends they suggest\nA brief interpretation: “What does this mean?” and “Why does it matter?”\n\nWhile students present:\n\nHighlight clarity of visualizations, originality of questions, or insightful interpretations.\nCelebrate one strong point from each group to model good data science communication.
