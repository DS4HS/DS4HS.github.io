## Instructions for Students (Delete This Slide Before Submitting)

- This is your **template** for presenting your mini research project.

- Your final presentation should have **4 slides**:
  1. Research Question + Dataset
  2. Data Wrangling Code
  3. Plot + ggplot Code
  4. Key Insights

Once youâ€™ve completed the slides, **delete this instruction slide** before rendering.

## Slide 1: Your Dataset & Research Question

**Dataset Chosen:**  
> _e.g., Tree Equity data from Alabama, Arizona, etc._

```{r}
#| echo: false

# read in your dataset here
```

**Research Question:**  
> _Write the question you're investigating using this dataset._

## Slide 2: Data Wrangling

Use tidyverse functions like `filter()`, `mutate()`, `select()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, etc. Show all the code that's you used to clean or transform the data for your plot.

```{r}
#| echo: false
# delete line above before running code 


```

## Slide 3: Plot

Use `ggplot2` to visualize your findings. Include code and plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
# delete line above before running code 

```


## Slide 4: Key Takeaways

What did you learn from your analysis? **Only render the answer to questions and not the questions themselves.** 

- What patterns or disparities did you observe?
- What conclusions can you draw from your plot?
- Why do these findings matter?
