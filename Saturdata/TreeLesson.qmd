## 🌐 The Big Idea: Why Urban Planning

> Urban planning **IS** data science in action.

## 

<div style="text-align: center;">

<h1>HOW??</h1>

## What is Data Science??

-   From IBM US: Data science is the practice of "uncovering actionable insights hidden in data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning."
-   🎓 Schools study attendance and grade trends to identify students who may need extra support before they fall behind.
-   🏥 Hospitals use patient records and trends to predict who's at risk for certain illnesses --- helping doctors intervene earlier.

## Data Science Cycle -\> Urban Planning Cycle

    Observe [label='Observe a Problem']
    Collect [label='Collect Data']
    Analyze [label='Analyze & Present']
    Intervene [label='Intervene']

## 🌳 Introduction: Tree Equity and City Planning

-   Tree Planting is a direct action of City Planning Initiatives
-   Why do some neighborhoods have less trees than others? How are these Neighborhoods affected? What can we do?

## American Forests: Tree Equity Score

![](TES.png)

-   Tree Canopy Coverage...
    -   Improves Air Quality and Stabalizes Enviromental Hazzards
    -   Intercepts Rainfall and prevents Stormwater Runnoff
    -   Reduces Heat extremity improving peoples physical and mental health

## Todays Goals

-   Learn to use R for data analysis and communication
-   Understand what makes a dataset meaningful
-   Ask important questions about data and the observed world
-   Explore how data can inform **just** and **sustainable** practices

## A Look at the data

### California Tree Coverage Data [^1]

[^1]: "Tree Equity Score. 2023. American Forests."

```{r}
library(readr)
ca_tes <- read_csv("ca_csv/ca_tes.csv")

head(ca_tes, 1)
```

## An Observation

> Observational Unit: object by which data is collected and analyzed

-   Person

-   County

-   State

-   Country

-   *What is the observational unit in the `ca_tes` data set?*

## 

```{r}
ca_tes[1, ]
```

-   The GEOID or Census block Group describes a particular community or neighborhood in a given area contains between 600 - 3,000 people [^2]

[^2]: American Forests Methods and Data Glossary

## What are the Variables?

-   `treecanopy`: Actual tree coverage in an area
-   `tc_goal`: Ideal tree coverage based on needs
-   `tc_gap`: How far behind the area is (tc_goal - treecanopy)
-   `pctpocnorm`: % residents who are people of color
-   `pctpovnorm`, `unemplnorm`: Indicators of equity
-   `lingnorm`: % of non-english households (linguistic isolation)
-   `tes`: Tree Equity Score (gap × need)

## What do we want to know

-   **Its not always easy to start analyzing such a large data set. Thats why it is important to ask SMART questions**
-   **S**pecific: Clear, detailed, and not too broad
-   **M**easureable: Can be answered using the available data
-   **A**pplicable: Tied to real-world meaningful contexts
-   **R**easoned: Based on logic or a thoughtful assumption
-   **T**estable: Can be analyzed to reveal patterns or relationships

## SMART vs. Not-so-SMART Questions

**Don't ask:**

-   Is "given neighborhood" affected?
-   Does tree coverage matter?

**Instead ask:**

-   *How does tree coverage relate to income in LA neighborhoods?*
-   *Is the tree coverage gap higher in areas with high unemployment?*

<h1>Going From Question to Answer</h1>

## Data Wrangling

Before we can answer our questions, we need to **prepare** the data.

Data wrangling includes:

-   Cleaning messy or incomplete data
-   Selecting the most relevant information
-   Reshaping data into a usable form
-   Creating new variables that help us analyze

🧹 Think of it like *organizing your workspace before starting a project*.

## Mathlink Cubes

![](Mathlink/dataset.jpg)

## `filter()`: Keep Certain Rows

`filter()` lets us select only the rows that meet specific conditions.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

filter(red == "triangle")
```

. . . 

![](Mathlink/filter.jpg)

## `select()`: Keep Certain Columns

`select()` lets us keep only the variables (columns) we care about.


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

select(red, green)
```

. . . 

![](Mathlink/select.jpg)

## `mutate()`: Add a New Insightful Column

`mutate()` lets us create a new column (variable) by transforming existing ones.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Triangle = yes, Square = no
mutate(is_hexagon = (blue == "hexagon"))
```

. . . 

![](Mathlink/mutate.jpg)

## `arrange()`: Ordering our data

`arrange()` Sort rows by the values of a variable (ascending or descending).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Hexagon → Square → Triangle → Pentagon.
arrange(purple)
```

. . . 

![](Mathlink/arrange.jpg)

## `group_by()` and `summarise()`: Summariing by Category

`group_by()` lets us group the data by a specific variable.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2"

group_by(yellow)|> 
summarize(count = n())
```

. . . 

![](Mathlink/group_by.jpg)

## Now you Try

## 

> Show only neighborhoods with low tree equity scores (`tes` \< 50)

-   Hint: `filter()`

. . .


```{r}
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)
ca_tes|>
  filter(tes < 50)
```

## 

> Focus on `treecanopy`, `tes`, and `unemplnorm` (keep these columns)

-   Hint: `select()`

. . .


```{r}
#| echo: true

ca_tes |>
  select(treecanopy, tes, unemplnorm)
```

## 

> What percent of the tree coverage goal has been met?

-   Hint: `mutate()`

. . .


```{r}
#| echo: true

ca_tes |>
  mutate(pct_coverage_met = treecanopy / tc_goal * 100)
```

## 

> Compute the average `tes` score by place

-   Hint: `group_by()` and `summarise()`

. . . 


```{r}
#| echo: true

ca_tes |>
  group_by(place) |>
  summarize(avg_tes = mean(tes, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Which neighborhoods have the greatest tree equity need?

. . . 


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2|3|4"
ca_tes |>
  select(GEOID, place, tes)|>
  arrange(tes)|>
  slice_head(n = 5)
```

## How does tree equity relate to both poverty and health disparity?

- create variable `combined_index` that connects `pctpovnorm` and `health_nor`
- cut data set down to desired variables (`place`, `combined_index`, and `tes`)
- organize data to see which places have highest combined index

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2|3|4|5"

ca_tes|>
  filter(!is.na(pctpovnorm), !is.na(health_nor))|>
  mutate(combined_index = pctpov * health_nor)|>
  select(place, combined_index, tes)|>
  arrange(desc(combined_index))

```

<h1>Visualizing the Data</h1>

## What and Why

-   Data visualization is the process of transforming raw data into visual formats, like charts, graphs, or maps, to make it easier to understand and interpret

-   Communicate Results **Clearly** and **Effectively**

-   Supports evidence-based decisions in fields like:

    -   Public health
    -   Climate research
    -   Urban planning
    -   Business & marketing

## What is ggplot2?

-   ggplot2 is an R package for data visualization.
-   It uses a grammar of graphics --- building plots in layers.
-   We always start with ggplot(data) and add layers with +.

## Basic Structure of a ggplot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "2|3|4|5"

# General structure
data|>
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
  geom_function() +
  labs("label for you plot and axes")
      
```

## Common `geom()` functions

-   geom_point(): scatterplots (x vs y)
-   geom_bar(): bar charts (categorical data)
-   geom_col(): bar chart with height from y var
-   geom_histogram(): distribution of numeric variable
-   geom_line(): trends over continuous x-axis

## Which plot should I use?

::: {.small}

| Variable Type   | Plot Type    | `geom()`?    | When to Use   |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Categorical             | Bar Chart    | `geom_bar()`       | Count frequency of categories      |
| Continuous              | Histogram    | `geom_histogram()` | Show distribution of one variables |
| Continuous + Continuous | Scatter Plot | `geom_point()`     | Explore relationships between vars |
| Continuous + Time       | Line Chart   | `geom_line()`      | Show change over time              |
| Category + Value        | Column Chart | `geom_col()`       | Compare totals across categories   |

## Tree Equity vs. Poverty

> Is there a relationship between poverty and tree equity?

. . . 


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

ca_tes|>
  ggplot(aes(x = pctpov, y = tes)) +
  geom_point(color = "green") + 
  labs(title = "Tree Equity vs. Poverty",
       x = "Percent in Poverty",
       y = "Tree Equity Score")
```

## Distribution of Tree Equity Scores

> How many places hac each Tree equity score? 

. . . 


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| #| code-line-numbers: "1|2|3|4|5|6"

ca_tes|>
  ggplot(aes(x = tes)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = "red") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Tree Equity Scores",
       x = "Tree Equity Score",
       y = "Number of Places")

```

## Tree Equity vs. Linguistic Isolation

> Is there a relationship between linnguistic isolation(`lingnorm`) and `tes`in an area. 

  - Use ggplot to plot the relationship between `tes` and `lingnorm`
  - Choose the best plot for the variable types
  - Create fitting labels for your axes and plot title

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| #| code-line-numbers: "1|2|3|4|5|6"

ca_tes|>
  ggplot(aes(x = lingnorm, y = tes)) +
  geom_point(color = "turquoise") + 
  labs(title = "Tree Equity vs. Linguistiv Isolation",
       x = "Percent in Linguistic Isolation",
       y = "Tree Equity Score")
```
